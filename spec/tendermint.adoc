== Abstract
The Manifest Network currently uses ABCI for its blockchain implementation.
Most modules developed by The Lifted Initiative can run behind a blockchain, provided that blockchain is implemented using tendermint and a pair of special modules to integrate with it.
The goal of this document is to describe the interaction between the blockchain module (#1), the two ABCI modules (#1000 and #1001), and Tendermint itself.

== Background
In order to implement the generic blockchain attribute, a network has to have a consistent and well known blockchain implementation.
Tendermint is the most chosen POS BFT consensus engine available.

As an alternative example, Substrate was also considered as an alternative and may have become an implementation in the future.
This would not invalidate this document as both Substrate and Tendermint can be used as a backend for the blockchain attribute in the MANY protocol.
As long as MANY attributes are respected and the MANY protocol is used to communicate, any blockchain implementation can be interconnected.

Tendermint has been chosen for its well documented API, good performance, ease of use and integration, and its versatility.

== Design
Any module that can be executed in a "blockchain-mode" MUST implement the ABCI Backend (#1000) attribute.
The ABCI Backend attribute implements all the ABCI calls necessary to implement a Tendermint ABCI App.

On the server, a MANY-ABCI bridge process should transform MANY requests into two categories;

1. Queries, which don't affect the state and can be forwarded directly to the backend.
2. Commands, which affect the state and should be sent (using `deliver_tx`) to Tendermint to queue in the mempool.

This process MUST implement the ABCI frontend attribute (#1001), to let people verify that the blockchain itself is a Tendermint.

For example, if a Ledger server is running, the components would look like this:

[plantuml, format=png]
....
card "Ledger Server\n #2" as ledger {
    agent "ABCI Backend\n #1000" as be
}
card "Tendermint" as tendermint {
}
card "Tendermint" as tendermint2 {
}
card "MANY-ABCI bridge" as bridge {
    agent "ABCI Frontend\n #1001\n (#1 from backend)\n (#2 for blockchain)"
}

tendermint -up-> ledger : 127.0.0.1:26658
tendermint <-down-> bridge : 127.0.0.1:26657
tendermint <-right-> tendermint2 : 127.0.0.1:26656
ledger <-up-> bridge : 127.0.0.1:8000
....

=== Initialization
The initialization of the MANY ABCI bridge essentially lookup the backend's `status` to get the list of attributes and arguments from it.
It should then remove the ABCI Backend attribute and endpoints from the list to build its own internal status information.

Once the bridge has checked that both backends are online and responding,

In pseudo-code, the initialization of the bridge should look like:

[source, javascript]
....
function initialize(backend_url, tendermint_url) {
    let many_client = new ManyClient(backend_url)
    let tendermint_client = new TendermintTcpClient(tendermint_url)

    let many_status = many_client.call_status()
    tendermint_client.call_status()  // Verify the tendermint instance is ready.

    // The name can vary, but it is recommended to include the name of the backend.
    let name = "MANY-ABCI Bridge (" + many_status.name + ")"

    let attributes = many_status.attributes.filter(a => a.id != 1000).concat([1001])
    let endpoints = many_client.call("abci.init").endpoints  // See Attribute #1000

    let status = new Status(attributes, endpoints);

    return create_many_server(envelope => { /* See the message forwarding section */ })
}
....

=== Message Passing
When the MANY-ABCI bridge frontend receives a message, it has one of 3 options;

1. handle it internally, for example for the blockchain or base network attributes.
2. send it to the backend directly.
3. send it to Tendermint for queueing it in the mempool.

The way to differentiate between the second and third option is to keep an internal list of endpoints for the backend app (which you get by calling `abci.init`), which contains a type property which determines if a call is a query (send it directly), or a command (queue it in the mempool).

In pseudo-code, the bridge initialization looks like this:

[source, javascript]
....
function initialize(backend_url, tendermint_url) {
    let many_client = new ManyClient(backend_url)
    let tendermint_client = new TendermintTcpClient(tendermint_url)

    let status = /* See initialization above. */ new Status(...);

    let endpoints = many_client.call("abci.init").endpoints.filter(...);

    return create_many_server(envelope => {
        let message = decode_envelope(envelope);
        switch (endpoints) {
            case "status": return status;
            case "endpoints": return new Set([
                ...NetworkAttributes.Base.endpoints,
                ...NetworkAttributes.Blockchain.endpoints,
                ...endpoints
            ]);
            case "heartbeat": return null;
        }

        if (endpoints.contains(message.method)) {
            let info = endpoints[message.method];
            if (info.is_command) {
                let tx = await tendermint_client.deliver_tx(envelope);
                // The transaction hash is used as the async token.
                return new Envelope(this.identity, null, [ResponseAttributes.ASYNC(tx.hash)]);
            } else {
                return many_client.send_envelope(envelope);
            }
        }
        throw new MethodNotFound(message.method);
    })
}
