== Attribute Format
Attributes are numeral indices into a table of additive attributes.
The exact number is taken from the attribute blockchain.

== Network Attributes
These attributes are associated to a network and give a list of the capabilities of the network.

=== Private Attributes
Any negative attribute is reserved for experimental or private attributes that the network might define within itself, advertise, but is not yet finalized or adopted.
The rest of the fields are up to the internal implementation.
Unless a system is certain of the meaning of the attribute for a specific network, it should not interpret those attributes itself.

=== Implementation specific Attributes
Some attributes can be implementation specific, and will implement both the generic attribute endpoints, and its own implementation specific endpoints.

For example, the blockchain attribute (1) implement endpoints that are generic to all blockchains or when dealing with blocks in general.
An implementation of a blockchain, for example, might add more methods to manage the blockchain itself.

=== Return Values
Some attributes may change the return value of related attributes.
This is important as not every attribute is synchronous.

For example, the Mailbox attribute, which allow a server to store and delay sending messages and their responses, will never return a message when sending messages.

Processes who expect answers in the proper schema will most likely fail.
That's normal.

A CBOR tag on the payload value (not in the bytestring) must be added by those processes to let the caller know there was a different result.
The tags are specified per attribute.

A tag MUST NOT be added to the result if the value follows the schema specified by the attribute specification.
