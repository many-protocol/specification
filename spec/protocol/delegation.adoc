== Introduction

The MANY protocol relies on digital signatures of messages to identify users and servers.
The resolution of the address is defined in the xref:envelope.adoc#_identity[Envelope – Identity] section.

This specification adds and describe an additional attribute and resolution step; delegation.
Delegation happens when an identity signs a delegation certificate to another identity, allowing the private key of the latter one to sign messages where the sender is the first one.

== Overview

Given the identities `Alice` and `Bob`, assuming `Alice` would like to allow `Bob` to impersonate them in a message.
`Alice` would sign a delegate certificate to `Bob`, which `Bob` would include in their messages.
Servers use the certificate the resolve the identity.
It first sees `Bob` signature on the message, but resolve `Alice` identity using the certificate chain.

Multiple certificates can be included to allow for a chain of delegations.
The root of the chain will be the final identity of the sender.
For example, if `Bob` were to delegate his identity to `Charlie`, `Charlie` could include both `Alice -> Bob` delegate certificate and `Bob -> Charlie` certificate in a message to impersonate `Alice`.

title Delegation Request Sequence

actor alice as "Alice\nmabc..defg"
actor bob as "Bob\nmhij..klmn"
participant server as "Server"

== Certificate Creation ==
bob -> alice : Public Key
alice -> alice : `many delegate create`
alice -> bob : certificate

== Request ==

bob -> server : message\n\
    signature: mhij..klmn\n\
    from: mabc..defg\n\
    attributes: [2, certificate]
activate server
server -> bob : Response
deactivate server

=== Attributes

There are 3 attributes related to this specification:

- xref:../../attributes/network/10_delegation.adoc[10 – Delegation] which allows a server to sign delegations (if supported) and advertise they support delegation.
- xref:../../attributes/request/2_delegation.adoc[2 - Delegation (Request)] which allows requests to have a delegation.
- xref:../../attributes/response/2_delegation.adoc[2 - Delegation (Response)] which allows responses to have a delegation.

The certificate is described in the spec CDDL and referred by the attributes above.
Certificates are passed along with a request or response as an attribute, and are not part of the envelope.

=== Acceptance

A server who does not advertise xref:../../attributes/network/10_delegation.adoc[attribute 10] MUST error out if the attribute 2 is found in a request (see <<./attributes.adoc#_unknown_attributes,Unknown Attributes>>).

=== Anonymous

Please note that even though the anonymous address does not have a public key, it is a valid identity and can be delegated _to_, as well as from, although it has no utility.

== Resolution

A server supporting attribute 10 MUST add a resolution step 3 (see <<./envelope.adoc#_identity,Identity Resolution>>) that does the following:

1. look for attribute `2` in the `message`;
   a. if the attribute is not found, the server MUST use the previous resolved identity.
   b. if the attribute is found, read its argument and;
      . if the argument is an array of certificates, perform step 2 and 3 for each certificate, in order,
      . if the argument is a single certificate, perform step 2 and 3 once for it.

2. for each certificate, validate (in order);
   a. the signature using the same <<./envelope.adoc#_identity,Identity Resolution>> steps for a regular envelope,
   b. the `to` (1) field is the same as the identity resolved thus far (either the last identity resolved as part of this step, or the identity resolved from the message envelope),
   c. the `expiration` (2) field is still in the future (must also not be equal).
   d. if the `final` (4) field is `true`, and there are more certificates to evaluate, the server MUST return an error.

3. if all validation above pass, the latest identity is the `from` (0) field of the certificate.

=== Pseudocode

[source, javascript]
....
function resolveDelegation(sender, message) {
    let attr = message.attributes.get(2);
    if (!attr) {
        return sender;
    }

    let args = decodeCborArray(attr);
    for (let i = 0; i < args.length, i++) {
        let arg = args[i];
        let envelope = decodeCborEnvelope(arg);
        let from = validateSignature(envelope);
        if (!from) {
            throw new Error();
        }
        if (from.isIllegal() || sender.isIllegal()) {
            throw new Error();
        }

        let cert = decodeCborDelegationCertificate(envelope.payload);
        if (!from.matches(cert.from)) {
            throw new Error();
        }
        if (!sender.matches(cert.to)) {
            throw new Error();
        }
        if (cert.expiration <= now) {
            throw new Error();
        }
        if (cert.final && i < args.length) {
            throw new Error();
        }

        sender = cert.to;
    }

    return sender;
}
