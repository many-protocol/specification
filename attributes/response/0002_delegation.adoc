= Delegation Response Attribute (#2)
:cddl: ./cddl/

This attribute is used to delegate the `from` field of a response message to a different identity than the one used to sign the envelope.

For more details, see xref:../../spec/protocol/delegation.adoc[Delegation].

== Argument

A server returning this response MUST pass an argument that is either a certificate or an array of certificates:

[source,cddl]
....
include::{cddl}/2_delegation.cddl[]
....
