= Async Response Attribute (#1)
:cddl: ./cddl/

This attribute is used along with an empty payload to indicate that the call was a success but there is no response available at this time.
This is the case when the server delay a response (for example, a blockchain might have queued a command on the block but does not have a reply yet).

Having an actual response payload is specific to the network attributes.

== Argument
An argument MAY be provided with the attribute which contains a token.
This token can be used with certain attributes to gather information about the async call.
