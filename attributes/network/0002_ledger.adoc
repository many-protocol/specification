= Ledger Attribute (#2)
:cddl: ./cddl/

This attribute is used by servers that implements an ledger interface which contains a map of accounts and symbols to amount held.
It does not have to be backed by a blockchain (but it MAY be if it implements attribute #1).
It also does not have to list transactions.

An account must be an identity which can be a subresource.

It exposes the following endpoints:

- <<_info, `ledger.info`>>. Returns information about this ledger.
- <<_balance, `ledger.balance`>>. Returns the balance of the account specified (or the sender).
- <<_send, `ledger.send`>>. Send tokens between ledgers.

== Accounts
Accounts are non-anonymous identities.

== Errors
The following error codes are reserved for ledger servers:

- 20001, `unknown_symbol(symbol)`.
    A symbol name is unknown.
- 20002, `unauthorized`.
    A user is not authorized to make this transaction.
- 20003, `insufficient_funds`.
    An account does not have enough funds for a transaction.

== Info
The `ledger.info` endpoint returns general information about the ledger.
