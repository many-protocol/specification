= ID Store Attribute (#10)
:cddl: ./cddl/

Servers use this attribute to implement an identity store containing a map of easy-to-remember words to `identity`.
It does not have to be backed by a blockchain (but it MAY be if it implements attribute #1).

A user cannot modify an entry after it is stored.

It exposes the following endpoints:

- <<_store, `idstore.store`>>. Store a new words/identity map.
- <<_get, `idstore.get`>>. Get an identity from words.

== Errors
`idstore` servers reserve the following error codes:

- 100001, `existing_entry`.
    The entry key already exists in the storage.
- 100002, `entry_not_found`.
    Storage was unable to find entry.

== Store
Store a new entry words/identity pair in the persistent storage
