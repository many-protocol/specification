= Event Log Attribute (#4)
:cddl: ./cddl/

This attribute is used by servers that implements an event log interface which keeps a list of events performed on it.
This can be a list of transactions for a ledger server, for example.
It does not have to be backed by a blockchain (but it MAY be if it implements attribute #1).

It exposes the following endpoints:

- <<_info, `events.info`>>. Returns information about this server's event log.
- <<_list, `events.list`>>. List event logs.

== Addresses
Servers MAY recognize identities as part of their logs and allow filtering by address.

== Errors
The following error codes are reserved for event logs:

== Types
