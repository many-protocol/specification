= Base Server Attribute (#0)
:cddl: ./cddl/

This attribute exposes the basic information of the server.

It exposes the following endpoints:

- <<_status, `status`>>.
    Get the status of the network, its given name (non-unique), address (unique), public key, and any other information the server wants to make available (free form dictionary).
- <<_heartbeat, `heartbeat`>>.
    Returns no data.
- <<_endpoints, `endpoints`>>.
    Returns a (maybe incomplete) list of all supported endpoints.

== Status
The `status` endpoint returns informations related to the network.
It does not take any argument.

== Heartbeat
The `heartbeat` endpoint returns no bytes at all. It can be used to
see if the server is alive.

== Endpoints
The `endpoints` endpoint returns a map of endpoints to their information, supported by this network.
The list MAY be imcomplete, but endpoints returned by this call MUST be supported and have the correct information.

Some networks don't know if they implement an endpoint before trying to execute a message (for example, if the endpoint is conditional on the sender).
Those networks are not obligated to return endpoints that it might not want to expose.
Another example are proxy networks which may or not know the actual list of endpoints as it differs based on the backend itself.

A server MAY return an empty map.
