== Ledger Account Feature Attribute (#0)
:cddl: ./cddl/

This attribute adds support for ledger transactions available to a regular identity on a ledger.
If this attribute is present in an account, any allowed (see <<Role>>) identities can perform regular transactions that would be possible from their identities, from this account.

Verification that the sender is able to transact on behalf of an account is left to the server.

For example, a `ledger.send` call with an able account as the source identity would perform transactions from this account.

== Role
A new role is added by this feature, `"canLedgerTransact"`, which allow any identities to perform regular ledger transactions.
Identities MUST either be an `'"owner"` or have this role to be allowed to perform transactions.
