== KvStore Account Feature Attribute (#2)
:cddl: ./cddl/

This attribute adds support for kvstore transactions available to a regular identity on a kvstore.
Any allowed (see <<Role>>) identities listed in an account using this attribute can perform regular transactions on behalf of the account.

Verification that the sender is able to transact on behalf of an account is left to the server.

For example, a `kvstore.put` call with an able account as the source identity would perform transactions from this account.

== Role
Two new roles are added by this feature,

- `"canKvStorePut"`, which allow any identities to (over-)write a VALUE located at KEY.
- `"canKvStoreDisable"`, which allow any identities to disable/delete a KEY and its VALUE.

Identities MUST either be an `"owner"` or have those roles to be allowed to perform transactions.
