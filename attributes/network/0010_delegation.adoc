= Delegation Attribute (#10)
:cddl: ./cddl/

This attribute allows server to verify and create delegation certificates.
A server can refuse to create a certificate for any reason.
For example, it could only allow delegations to safe listed identities.

A server MAY error if too many certificates are contained in a message.

== Endpoints

There is 2 endpoints: `delegate.createCertificate()` and `delegate.whoAmI()`.
Both resolve the identity from the message itself.

`delegate.createCertificate()` delegates the server's identity, if possible, to the address of the message.
Servers are not under any obligation to delegate their identities, and MAY refuse all requests to this endpoint.

`delegate.whoAmI()` returns the address that was understood from the message.
Using a similar message to a different endpoint would result in the same identity being used.
The server MUST ignore the payload entirely.
