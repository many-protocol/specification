= Account Attribute (#9)
:cddl: ./cddl/
:toc:

== Overview
This document describes a network attribute that allows people to create accounts that can perform operations when certain conditions are met.

== Problem Statement
A regular feature for money management is having a multi-signature wallet, vault, dripping wallet or other special access accounts that execute transactions automatically and/or under certain rules.

== Use Cases
Some examples of multi signature wallets are already available in traditional banking;

*   1-of-2.
    A husband and wife shared account; either spouse can spend the funds without approval from the other.
*   2-of-2.
    A husband and wife savings account; both signatures are required to spend the funds.
*   2-of-3.
    Parentsâ€™ savings account, where the child can spend with the approval of either parent, and money cannot be taken away unless both parents agree.
*   3-out-of-7.
    Low-trust donation. 7 people have a private key, but any 3 can sign a transfer.
*   1 or 3-of-4.
    Distributed backup. The private key can be recovered with 3 of the 4 parts, which can be distributed into safes or friends.

Some example of dripping wallet's use cases include;

*   vesting schedule for employees, in tokens.
*   rent or loan payments.
*   automatic transfer of funds to an execution network as gas payment.

== Requirements
*   An account MUST own itself.
    See the <<_owner_role>> section.
*   Accounts are referred to by their identities.
*   A server creating an account MUST use a subresource address of its own identity for the identity of the account, or a public key it owns.

== Detailed Design
The simplified design for this attribute is to add the basics for account management, and let account features decide how the account act.
Each type of account features should be distinct.
A server might support multiple account features, and apply multiple compatible features to the same account.

A new namespace is created through this attribute; `account`, which contains the following basic methods implemented by this attribute:

* `account.create`.
    Creates an account and sets its owner(s).
* `account.setDescription`.
    Set the name to a new one.
* `account.listRoles`
    List all the roles supported by the account.
* `account.getRoles`
    Get the roles of one or multiple identities.
* `account.addRoles`
    Add roles to an identity.
* `account.removeRoles`
    Remove roles from an identity.
* `account.info`.
    Retrieves information related to an account.
* `account.disable`.
    Disables an account.
    The server MAY delete the account from its database.
    The identity MUST not be reusable.
    The server MAY still return the info using `account.info`, with the disabled field filled, or return an error.
    The server MUST error on all endpoints that would change the account.
* `account.addFeatures`
    Add features to an account.

=== Information
An account has metadata associated with it.
For example, it can have a name, a list of features and their arguments, and a map of identities and their roles.

Once an account has been created, features cannot be removed, nor their argument can be changed.
New features can be added to an account as long as they don't interfere with previous features of that account.

=== Features
Features are specified through network attributes, exposed by the network's `status`, and attribute IDs set in the information of an account.

The server MUST return an error on creation if two features are not compatible or supported with each others.

The list of features is available through the attribute's arguments returned by the server's `status` endpoint.

=== Roles
Accounts have a map of identities to a list of roles internally.
Identities can have multiple roles, with their actual access control defined by each feature available.

A server MAY return an error if too many roles and identities are added to an account.
For example, a server might want to limit its internal list of owners per accounts to 20, or maximum of roles per identity to 10, or any combination of these.

Roles are case sensitive strings.
Trying to add a role that isn't defined by the features associated with an account MUST result in an error.

To list roles available for an account (depending on its features), call the `account.listRoles`.
To list the roles of an identity, call the `account.getRoles`. To add roles to an identity, use the `account.addRoles` endpoint, and `account.removeRoles` to remove one or multiple roles.

==== Owner Role
An account MUST own itself.
Removing the `"owner"` role from the account MUST result in an error.

By default, only an owner can set roles of identities on an account, or disable it.
Some additional access control might be provided to account owners by features.

`"owner"`s have all other roles implicitly, as they can add any roles to themselves.

`"owner"` is the only required role for an account.
Any additional roles should be defined by features.

== Constraints
The design has a few flaws that can be mitigated:

* There is a limit of ~2 billions accounts per server identity as the specification says that accounts must be subresource identities.
  The first way to mitigate this would be to charge a price per account creation, to reduce the chance of abuse.
  This can be implemented by servers. +
  Another way is by creating new private keys to allow for more sub resources.
  This process can be done in a secure way, but needs to be researched further before being part of this specification.
* Redefining the address type in the protocol to allow for larger addresses (e.g. up to 64 bytes).
